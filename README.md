# Food Order App  
## Day 32  
In order to revise what i have been working on lately, i will create a food order app containing all the the new things i have learned and how to use them. Firstly i will be adding a Header to my App.  
## Day 33  
I will be adding a Cart Button Component to my app and a Meals Component so as to build slowly and assessing what i have done so far. After that i will display in the app the individual meal items and work on adding a form in the future.  
## Day 34  
I will finish building components by adding a Form and a Cart to my app and applying a style to them. After some adjustments to the Form Input IDs my App is ready to go to the next level.  
## Day 35  
In my app now i want to make the cart usable and available to be clicked and hide every time i want. I will add a Modal via a React Portal looking like this ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/174860007-01de511f-eac0-4d0e-a6a7-ac6f267d5d05.png)  
After managing its state my Cart is now accesible to be clicked and hide.  
## Day 36  
I will be adding a Cart Context and use it in my app and create 2 new files under the name of cartProvider.js and cart-context.js. My code looks like this now ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/175091311-162d7d7d-4500-4c15-bfb1-ca2f482eea94.png) After using useReducer in the CartProvider.js in order to add a Cart Reducer my next step will be working with Forward Refs  
## Day 37  
I will be spending my day now working with Forward Refs and trying to understand their usage and how they intervene in my code. My MealItemForm.js file then gets upgraded and looks like this
